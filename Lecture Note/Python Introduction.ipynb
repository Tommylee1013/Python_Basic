    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Python? \n",
    "\n",
    "- Python is a popular general-purpose programming language that is designed to handle a wide range of problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Recent developments have extended Python's range of applicability to econometrics, statistics and general numerical analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Components of the Python Scientific Stack\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Python\n",
    "    - This provides the core Python interpreter. The latest version is Python 3.7, but I personally prefer Python 3.6 due to dependencies issue. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. NumPy \n",
    "    - NumPy provides a set of array and matrix data types which are essential for statistics, econometrics and data analysis. \n",
    "3. SciPy\n",
    "    - SciPy contains a large number of routines needed for analysis of data. The most important include a wide range of random number generators, linear algebra routines, and optimizers.\n",
    "4. Jupyter and IPython\n",
    "    - IPython provides an interactive Python environment which enhances productivity when developing code or performing interactive data analysis. Jupyter provides a generic set of infrastructure that enables IPython to be run in a variety of settings including an improved console (QtConsole) or in an interactive webbrowser based notebook.\n",
    "5. Matplotlib and seaborn \n",
    "    - matplotlib provides a plotting environment for 2D plots, with limited support for 3D plotting. seaborn is a Python package that improves the default appearance of matplotlib plots without any additional code.\n",
    "6. Pandas \n",
    "    - Pandas provides high-performance data structures.\n",
    "7. Statsmodels\n",
    "    - statsmodels is pandas-aware and provides models used in the statistical analysis of data including linear regression, Generalized LinearModels (GLMs), and time-series models (e.g., ARIMA).\n",
    "8. scikit-learn (sklearn)\n",
    "    - scikit-learn provides machine learning models for regression, classification, etc. \n",
    "9. quantecon\n",
    "    - The quantecon python library consists of a number of modules which includes game theory (game_theory), markov chains (markov), random generation utilities (random), a collection of tools (tools), and other utilities (util)."
